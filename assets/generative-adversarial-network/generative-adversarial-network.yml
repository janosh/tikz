  Generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. A GAN has two parts. The discriminator $D$ acts as a classifier that learns to distinguish fake data produced by the generator $G$ from real data. $G$ incurs a penalty when $D$ detects implausible results. This signal is backpropagated through the generator weights such that $G$ learns to produce more realistic samples over time, eventually fooling the discriminator if training succeeds.
