description: A plot illustrating the Fermi-Dirac distribution function for different temperatures relative to the chemical potential ($\epsilon/\mu$). The plot demonstrates how the occupation number ($n(\epsilon)$) changes as the temperature increases from zero to higher values. The visualization also highlights the effect of thermal fluctuations, which increase with higher temperatures.
